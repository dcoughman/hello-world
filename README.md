My first repository
I love to swim three to four times a week. On the days that I don't swim I jump rope and do other strength and body weight excersizes. 

When I was a kid I learned how to code in Basic and then in high school I learned Pascal.  I was a little bit of a nerd.  Now I am interested in learning Javascript.  I don't think that it should be too hard as I probably already know most of the concepts.
